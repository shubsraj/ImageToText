# _Image to Text_

# __Intro__

Here I worked on Computer Vision library OpenCV and Google API library pytesseract' to extract text from that image.
for selecting the image I used the 'Tkinter' library which is a UI library.

# __Working__

the program takes an image and then do some operations on that image for example sharpening and boosting the contrast so that 
text can be extracted easily and then used google API to extract that from the image and get the response as string text.
